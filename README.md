# Lecture Documents: Gov 50, Fall 2020
These .Rmd files are companion documents for lectures I delivered for Gov 50: Data at Harvard. These documents aren't exhaustive introductions to these topics (for more detail, please see a textbook like [Kosuke Imai's Quantitative Social Science](http://qss.princeton.press/)), but instead are "cheat sheet" type documents that cover the fundamentals for students in this course. Further resources for the course can be found [here](https://github.com/wyatthurt/gov-50-solutions).

Gov 50 covers the fundamentals of data and statistical inference using R, including data collection, visualization (primarily with tools like tidyverse and Shiny), the Rubin Causal Model, and regression modeling.

Topics include:
1. [Bayesian regression](docs/stan_glm.Rmd)
2. [stan_glm with a single covariate](docs/stan_glm_covariates.Rmd)
3. [stan_glm with multiple covariates](docs/stan_glm_multiple_covariates.Rmd)
4. [Bootstrapping](docs/bootstrap.Rmd)
5. [Model selection](docs/model_selection.Rmd)
